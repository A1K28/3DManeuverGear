 * instead onLeftItemUsed() will be used if the player left clicks and onRightItemUsed() will be called if the player right clicks.
 * This is done automatically via event handling and the methods will be called on the client and on the server.
 *
 * There will also be a weapon rendered in the left hand, both in first person and third person,
 * the appropriate coordinate transformations are automatically taken care of, there is still the possibility to scale, translate and rotate the
 * item after this.
